to do the junit test first you right click on your class and select unit test. 
select the version with a 4 and click next and finish.
it should have created a test file for you with methods like...

 	public void testCar() {}
	
	 	 public void testEqualsCar() {}
		  
    			public void testEqualsObject() {}
	
      				public void testToString() {}
        
these methods help figure out if your code is working properly
